# About
Trying to set up a minecraft server on my raspberry pi proved a real pain because of the oudatedness of the repos. I had to search high and low on the internet to find all the correct packages. This repo cleans up the installation process into a simple .deb file which can be installed after some brief configuration to your raspberry pi, downloading all the necessary dependencies and software, as well as the server file itself, and setting up a simple command to start the server!
