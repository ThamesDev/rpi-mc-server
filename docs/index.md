## Purpose

We spent ages trying to work out how to get a Minecraft Server up and running on a Raspberry Pi, battled lots of dependency errors, and
made this script to ensure others don't need to go through the trouble.

Find out more about installation [here](https://thamesdev.github.io/rpi-mc-server_1.0-1_arm32/installation.html).
